# Carousel
include three editions: js, jq and css3 and some images 

### css3
This directory includes a css file which is the most important. It makes the carousel move automatically and you can choose a 
serial number to show the relevant image. It also realize the function that when the mouse is over the container, the carousel will 
stop and when your mouse leave the container, it will continue.

### js
It can realize the same functions like css3. What's more, you can also click two buttons to control the carousel to move left or 
right. But there is a bug that when it show the first image, the serial dot is not white as normal.

### jq
It can realize the same functions like js. And there are two editions. The edition1.0 makes the carousel play automatically with 
the function named setInterval.But setInterval has sleep mode, it will affect the show. The edition2.0 resolves the problem through 
using the function setTimeout.
